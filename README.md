# Hi, I'm Daniel :wave: :man_technologist:

I am a web developer passionate about building simple and practical user interfaces. I am working to build community and engage youth in tech in West Africa.
I mainly work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Rails. Recently I added React and Gatsby to my toolbox.<br/>
**I am actively looking for a remote position in a startup.**
